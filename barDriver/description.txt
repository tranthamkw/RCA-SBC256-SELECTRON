Selector bar driver:

Accepts digital (5V positive logic) input to toggle selector bar between 0V and -100V.

Q-point: All bars at 0V to maintain current to eyelets.
To select a window (bit address), the four bars surrounding the window must be at 0V.  Deslected window will have at least one bar at -100V

Digital in
0 => Bar voltage at GND
1 => Bar voltage at -250V (or whatever negative voltage is being used. -250 is optimum)
